# Numerical-Linear-Algebra
CS352

Numerical methods for solving matrix and related problems in science and engineering using a high-level matrix-oriented language such as MATLAB. Topics include systems of linear equations, least squares methods, and eigenvalue computations. Special emphasis given to applications.

Covers topics like QR factorization, Singular Value Decomposition, Rayleigh Quotient, the Householder algorithm, the QR algorithm, Power Iteration and Inverse Iteration among others. The text used was Trefethen's Numerical Linear Algebra.
